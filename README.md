# Into Space

### **Please note that this game is currently a prototype and it is yet unknown whether it will be continued or not.**

### **Also note that some code parts are pretty messy, because I was running out of time. The entire codebase should be improved if this is to be continued.**

## Features
- Sandbox gameplay (you can destroy and place blocks)
- Day-night time cycle (with ray-traced lightning)
- Difficulty progression (each planet you travel to, enemies become stronger)
- Simple quests for player guidance
- Random terrain generation
- Terrain wraps around (meaning it's round, if you walk on one side, you'll end up at the start)
- 3 planets
- 1 enemy (ghost)
- A rocket (which you can use for shopping and travelling to other planets)

## Development
You are free to fork this project and continue the work I have done. Read the license requirements below if you plan to do something with it.

Pull requests are welcome and I would gladly add maintainers if I don't find the time to work on this project.

## License
I have chosen GNU GPLv3 (basically you have to keep forks open source), because I don't know yet whether this project will be continued. If it will be discontinued, I will switch to MIT license or something. The reason for this is, I don't want this project to branch off and have infinite versions of it, although if you really want to do this, contact me.
